              To handle backlash from an influencer’s fans and mitigate negative publicity, I would clearly explain the actions taken and the reasons behind them. I’d engage with fans empathetically, highlight improvements in moderation policies, and, if possible, collaborate with the influencer on a joint statement. I’d monitor the situation, address misinformation promptly, and promote positive content to balance the narrative.
